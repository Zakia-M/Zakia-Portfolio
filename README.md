# [Project 1: SpaceX Falcon-9 first stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/Zakia-M/SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction)
![rocket landing](rocket landing.gif)

The aim of this project, is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.


# [Project 2: Building a Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Zakia-M/Building-a-Movie-Recommendation-System)
![recommandation screenshot](1.JPG)

This work aims to create a film recommendation system that integrates non-personalized recommendation techniques, based on popularity and association rules, and personalized techniques based on: collaborative filtering, user profile and synopsis of the films. In order to generate relevant recommendations for the user.


# [Project 3: Using the GPT 2 model for movie synopsis generation](https://github.com/Zakia-M/Using-the-GPT-2-model-for-movie-synopsis-generation)
![gpt-generation](gpt-generation.gif)

The objective of this project is to exploit the potential of the OpenAI GPT-2 model, to build a system for generating film synopses based on two large datasets known worldwide : Wikipedia Movie Plots (~35,000 movies descriptions) & The Movies Dataset (Metadata on over 45,000 movies from MovieLens)
